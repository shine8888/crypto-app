# Crypto News
Last year, I developed a simple website for cryptos. Then I recieved your requirement to develop some feature watch portfolio.
Instead of display in console and saving transactions in CSV file, I decided to continue develop my old project to fit your requirement with Front-End for displaying and Back-End handle process of transactions.
Right now, it will have these main features:
  1. HomePage: Display general information about the whole crypto markets.
  2. Crypto Currencies: Display list of top crypto currencies. When you click to one crypto, it will display the detail of that crypto.
  It will be contained: Chart, market cap, trading volumes, news...
  3. Exchanges: Display all exchanges: Trading volumes, Markets, Trust score.
  4. News: Display all news about the cryptos, and you can filter the news that related to the token you want.
  5. Trading: The page that you can send the token to other account and watch the transactions.
  6. Your Investment: Display all tokens that you invested: current balances. You can also filter the token you want.
  7. Login and Logout

For more details about how it works, you can check in the front-end and back-end README files. 

Thank you,
