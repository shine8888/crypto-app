# Crypto App
Hi all,
I decide to develop my project to fit your requirement with Front-End for displaying status of crypto currencies and other features that normal apps also have, like: login/logout, trading, investment summary, crypto news,... Back-End for handle process of transactions and other features that I will continue with in the future.

Right now, it will have these main features:
  1. HomePage: Display general information about the whole crypto markets.
  2. Crypto Currencies: Display list of top crypto currencies. When you click to one crypto, it will display the detail of that crypto.
  It will be contained: Chart, market cap, trading volumes, news...
  3. Exchanges: Display all exchanges: Trading volumes, Markets, Trust score.
  4. News: Display all news about the cryptos, and you can filter the news that related to the token you want.
  5. Trading: The page that you can send the token to other account and watch the transactions.
  6. Your Investment: Display all tokens that you invested: current balances. You can also filter the token you want.
  7. Login and Logout

Because I am kind of busy with projects in current company, so I just have a quick setup project with Backend(Typescript) and Frontend(ReactJs).

For more details about how it works, you can check in the front-end and back-end README files. 

Thank you,
